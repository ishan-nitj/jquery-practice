Lesson 1 and 2:

Advanatages of query over javascript:
It takes a while to become comfortable with JavaScript, and it's trickier to manipulate HTML elements directly with JavaScript than with jQuery. In order to help you build awesome websites faster, we're starting you off with jQuery.
jQuery provides a simple interface for the underlying JavaScript. It's easier for many users to learn jQuery first, then dive into the nitty-gritty JavaScript details later.
jQuery is much better at giving you immediate, visual results than regular JavaScript. By the end of this lesson, you'll have built your own interactive button!

=>jQuery is a library, or set of helpful add-ons, to the JavaScript programming language.

=>$(document).ready(function() {               
    $('#green').fadeOut(1000);//1000 ms
});

//html tag with id green will fade out when the document gets ready
 
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('div').fadeOut(1000); // there is also a fadein 
});

$(document).ready(function(){
$('div').slideDown('slow');   
});

//Observe in fadeOut ,slideDown --The first letter of second part is capital

//While using fadin ,initially element should not be visible.This can be done by setting the disaply equal to none.

You can think of the element name passed to jQuery as identical to the CSS element, only wrapped in quotes. 

=>Decoding jquery

-$() says, "hey, jQuery things are about to happen!"
Putting document between the parentheses tells us that we're about to work our magic on the HTML document itself.
-.ready(); is a function, or basic action, in jQuery. It says "hey, I'm going to do stuff as soon as the HTML document is ready!"
-Whatever goes in .ready()'s parentheses is the jQuery event that occurs as soon as the HTML document is ready.

Note that .ready(); ends with a semicolon. This tells jQuery that you're done giving it a command.

=>Linking jquery with html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div></div>
    </body>
</html>

**=>Nesting
-$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function(){
        $('div').fadeTo('fast',1);
    });
});

-$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function(){
        $('div').hide();
    });
});

=>Clickable button 
The button grows dark when you move cursor over it and fadesout when you move cursor out of it.
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('div').mouseenter(function(){
        $('div').fadeTo('fast',1);
    });
    $('div').mouseleave(function(){
        $('div').fadeTo('fast',0.5);
    });
});

=>variables in jquery
var $p = $('p');

variable stores the result of a jQuery selector $('p') in the variable $p . As you can see, this is just a handy way to save this information for later.

Ex:$(document).ready(function() {
    var $target=$('#four');
    $target.fadeOut('fast');
});

=>compound selector
$(document).ready(function(){
$('.pink,.red').fadeTo('slow',0);    
}    
);

**=>using this
Instead of using fadeOut() on all 'div's, we're just using it on this div, where this refers to the div you're clicking on.

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('div').click(function() {//we cannot put this here
        $(this).fadeOut('slow');
    });
});

=>toggling the panel
$(document).ready(function(){
$('.pull-me').click(function(){
$('.panel').slideToggle('slow');
}   
)
}    
);
